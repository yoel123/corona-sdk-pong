this is a pong clone made using my corona sdk framework. 

you can touch anywhere on the screen to move your paddle up and down.
i did this to test more countrol types . i also only implemented a prototype
of the pong game with its core mechanics.

i made this game before with my other frameworks:

js dom based(very old):
